# Adding More Than One Creator

On AO3, works can be shared between more than one Creator to reflect that a work
was a collaboration.

## Before You Begin

Decide who will post the work. _All other creators_ should make sure their
preferences are set correctly. Head to "My Preferences" and be sure that
`Allow others to invite me to be a co-creator.` is checked.

## Posting The Work

1. Go to `New Work` as normal.

2. Under _Preface_, after you add the title, check `Add co-creators`.

3. Type in the username you want to add. The username should pop-up for you.
   Click it to add. Repeat this step as many times as needed.

4. Once you post as a Draft OR post as a live work, co-creators will be emailed
   to confirm.

5. Co-creators should follow the instructions in the email to accept being
   added.
