The Dragon Age Archives are a project where I attempt to archive free
Bioware-official media related to Dragon Age on the
[Internet Archive](https://archive.org). The hope is that by archiving resources
to Internet Archive, the fandom will be able to retain access to freebies even
if social media sites fold or official sites are deleted or support is removed.

The archive _does not_ include fanworks or projects, unless those projects are
efforts to preserve official content.

Not all media was uploaded by myself. I do also favorite DA media uploaded by
other users which fits the above inclusion criteria, which adds it to the
archive. If you've uploaded items or found items which should be added, feel
free to let me know!

## RSS Feed

In addition to just visiting the link to browse the collection when you want to,
you can also follow the DA Archive RSS feed. Just
[copy this link](https://archive.org/services/collection-rss.php?collection=fav-enigmalea)
and add the address to your favorite RSS reader.
