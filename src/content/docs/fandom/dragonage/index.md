title: Dragon Age Resources
---

In this section of my website, you'll find a collection of resources
specifically for Dragon Age fans - resources for canon materials, meta, and
more! The list below is for resources from other people.

My own resources that I've created or shared have their own pages to the left,
as I typically have a lot more to say about them!

- [Dragon Age Wiki](https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon_Age_Wiki)

  - Resource for canon info. Hosted on fandom.com. (Check out my recommended
    [Stylus skins](/docs/opensource/stylus/) for fandom.com.)

- [The Last Court: A Detailed Plot Guide](https://archiveofourown.org/works/30037386)

    was deactivated on November 17th, 2020.
