## General Info

Hosted on AO3, this project is a very rough chronological order for all Dragon
Age media. It was born out of my desire to consume all the side media (books,
comics, videos, etc) in one year in chronological order. When I decided to plan
my attempt, I couldn't find a single source which listed when all of the media
took place.

I first compiled a table in a gDocs file and eventually moved it to AO3, where
there's been a major clean up of the google provided CSS and code.

The timeline includes my best guesses for when the media takes place. All titles
that can be are linked to the Dragon Age Wiki, which provides plot summaries,
and additional information about the media.

## Sources

Where possible, sources are linked to for media purchase, viewing, or download.
Certain media may have limitations for what source information I can provide.
Where various retailers may offer or offerings may be limited by region, I've
left the source blank so as to not show favor to any specific retailer and to
prevent issues with regional distributors.

Below is more information on potential media sources!

- **Books**

  Paperbacks are published by Tor Publishing in North America and Titan
  Publishing in the UK. Dark Horse has also published deluxe hardback editions
  of all of the novels. _Tevinter Nights_ (a collection of short stories) is
  currently excluded from the deluxe edition prints. The books are only
  available in English, but should be able to be purchased from most major
  bookstores and retailers. Comic book stores may also be able to order the
  deluxe editions for you.

- **Short Stories**

  Several short stories have been provided by Bioware for free. The short
  stories from DA:I forward are currently available both official Bioware sites
  and the Dragon Age Wiki, whereas the DA2 short stories are currently only on
  the wiki.

  I have compiled the short stories as eBooks for easier reading. Old copies are
  available for download on my [Google Drive](https://bit.ly/3nBBndu). I'm
  currently working on re-typsetting and formatting these in various fonts. More
  info coming soon!

- **Comics**

  Comics are published by Dark Horse comics in multiple formats and collections.
  The media timeline includes a link to the Dark Horse digital's full page for
  the compiled arc, rather than individual issues.

- **Web Comics**

  Two short web comics were published by Penny Arcade and are still available
  for free on their website.

- **Movie**

  _Dragon Age: Dawn of the Seeker_ aka _Doragon Eiji Buraddo Meiji no Seisen_ is
  a Japanese anime, currently available for streaming in the US on Hulu,
  Funimation, Crunchyroll, Amazon Prime, and Vudu. Physical copies are also
  available on DVD and BluRay.

- **TV Show**

  _Dragon Age: Absolution_ is a TV series available for viewing on Netflix.

- **Web Series**

  Two web series have been produced so far. Both are currently still available
  on YouTube. Links are in the media timeline. _Dragon Age: Redemption_ is also
  available on DVD.

## Free

There are a number of free medias including games, short stories, and web
series, listed above. The Media Timeline marks all free entries with a
checkmark.

## Archive

I've been attempting to archive the free DA media to the Internet Archive as
much as possible between other projects (see
[Dragon Age Archives](/docs/mine/archives)). If something has an archive
link, it's provided in case the other link goes dead or missing, with the hopes
that the Media Timeline will be usable well into the future.
