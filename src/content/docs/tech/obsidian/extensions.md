title: Themes, Extensions, & Snippets

Obsidian is highly customizable. Each vault you create is it's own environment
and can be catered to its uses; this allows you to - for example - have a
notebook specifically to learn another language which uses the multiple
spellcheck setting while your main notebook is set to spell check only your
primary language.

## Themes

### Themes I'm Using
