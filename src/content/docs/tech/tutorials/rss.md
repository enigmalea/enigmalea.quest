title: What is RSS?
---

RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication. It's an older technology which allows
applications to access websites in a machine-readable way to get updates. This
allows you to follow everything that you want to follow in one application and
to get the updates without having to visit each site. It's super useful for
following updates on personal sites and blogs not hosted on a specific social
media. It's an open file format, which means no one company can own it.

## What can you do with it?

As mentioned above, it's used for getting updates. What sort of updates?

- Blog updates
- Webcomic updates
- New fics posted to a specific tag on AO3
- [KilltheNewsletter](https://kill-the-newsletter.com/) (technically uses ATOM
  another feed standard but shhhhh)
- Follow social media accounts for platforms where you don't have an account
  (mostly Fediverse or web 1.0 social media)
- Update your own website automatically from other sources

You can also _provide_ updates to your own blog, website, gallery, etc, by
providing an RSS fee.

## Okay, I'm sold. Where do I get the updates?

In short, you need an RSS reader. There's lots of freemium RSS apps and people
like them for different reasons, but it's also possible that you're using
another software or service that has the ability to be a feed reader and you had
no idea!

- [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/)

  A free, open-source email client that also allows you to follow RSS feeds.

- [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)

  A free notetaking app which has an
  [RSS feed reader extension](https://github.com/joethei/obsidian-rss). Check
  out my other [Obsidian recommendations](/docs/obsidian/extensions).

- [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/)

  This free, open source ebook management software (with plug-ins that allow you
  to turn fanfics into ebooks), **also** has a feed reader. It's listed as at
  the "news" option.

- [Dreamwidth](https://www.dreamwidth.org)

  On Dreamwidth, you can add RSS feeds to have them show up on your Reading
  page. (Be aware that your reading list is public.)

- Outlook

  Both the web and desktop versions of Outlook support RSS feeds. I don't
  actually use Outlook outside of work, so I'm not certain if the mobile app
  supports them or not.

- Firefox & Chrome Extensions

  I don't have a specific suggestion here, but I did some googling and both
  browsers have a myriad of RSS reader extensions.

## FAQ

### Didn't Google kill RSS?

Well. No. But not for lack of trying. Google had a very popular RSS reader that
they killed, and with that (and other sites like twitter stopping support for
it), RSS has fallen out of public awareness. But it still exists! And it's still
useful! And it's something that corporations can't take from us!

The best part of RSS is that it's a decentralized protocol, so we can do
whatever we want with it. I firmly believe that fandom needs to embrace RSS as
one tool in our arsenal take back our place on the web.
