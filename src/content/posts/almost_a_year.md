I just did a small update to the site. While working on
[BobaBoard](https://www.bobaboard.com) volunteer docs someone asked if we could
have the sidebars uncollapsed by default, and I discovered that we could, so I
decided to do the same here in my **Sections**.

Earlier this week, I also noticed that the catppuccin style guide had changed
some to define a specific link color, so I updated my color scheme to support
the blue link color. I have to say, I do prefer it overall.

But most importantly, when I went to update this log, I realized that my first
major update to the site after switching to Docusaurus was done almost a year
ago. I've actually consistently been updating and maintaining a personal website
for a whole year! It's amazing what using the right tools can do for you!

I've been thinking about the future of the site, and I'd like to keep the
following goals in mind:

- **Getting out of Docusaurus.**

  _It's served me well, but I should really move to something where I have more
  control._

- **Adding more content.**

  _Instead of waiting forever to update some content, I need to focus more on
  getting stuff in here, even if it isn't perfect._

- **Nailing down a good CMS.**

  _Related to the above goal, if I want to start using my site more, I
  definitely need to make it quicker to get some content into. Trying out
  another CMS (or mastering Decap) might be the key._

- **Improving Accessibility.**

  _I really need to focus on upping my alt text game and making sure that my
  site remains accessible even as I move to other tools._

- **Adding More Integrations.**

  *I'd love to focus on giving people *one* place to visit to catch up with me,
  track me down, or see what I'm up to, rather than spreading everything across
  multiple accounts. I'm not sure how to go about this yet, but I've definitely
  been thinking about it!*

And that's it, a brief look at what I've done today and what I plan on doing
more of!
