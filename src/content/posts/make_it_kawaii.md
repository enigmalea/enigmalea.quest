I've actually done two major updates since the last update log. The first made
some tweaks to Netlify CMS (now Decap CMS) and updated some CSS.

**Decap CMS**

- Updated config to work with pages (I think).
- Styled backend with CSS so that it's not so blinding to use.

**CSS Updates (Round 1)**

While I was working on a Stylus UserCSS for another site, I realized that my
site was using a different text color than the Catpuccin style guide allowed for
on the dark theme. I decided to remedy that and that sent me down a rabbit hole.

- Updated text and header colors.
- Added colors for **strong** and _em_ tags
- Added a plugin for images lightbox.

I also updated frontmatter on all pages (in an attempt to work better with the
CMS), but I'm still running into some issues with the CMS set-up where page
titles/labels aren't showing. I'm very tempted to throw out this CMS and try
with a different one.

And then came the **Make It Kawaii** edition.

Between these two updates I added a tutorial to my Digital Garden, and when I
came back to finish updates to it, my ADD went into overdrive. It's so rare that
I manage to have inspiration to make something _cute_ that I went with it.

**CSS Updates (Round 2)**

- updated header colors to have a rainbow across levels
- updated title to rainbow gradientstyled HRs with a cute heart image
- \[fix] top bar no longer renders different on docs section! (I was applying a
  CSS tweak incorrectly)
- cleaned up styling on summary and details tags
- \[fix] corrected incorrect warning and error colors (I accidentally deleted
  these during the tutorial update)

**Layout & Content Updates**

- updated top bar navigation
- added badges and buttons
- removed twitter link
- added socials section
- updated credits
- \[fix] corrected docs with incorrect header levels (apparently, I had several
  H1s that should have been H2s and couldn't tell until I change the colors).

The overall look is a much cuter and quirky site invoking old school sites but
using new tech. Next up on my list:

- Attempting to add an updates module to my landing page linking to this blog
- FORMS - I want to add a form to my author's note page
- About Me page
- Webrings?
- Continue Decap CMS experimentation (maybe)
