It's spring time <strike>forget that it's summer</strike> and I finally decided
to do some digital gardening and catch up on a bunch of content that I've wanted
to add to the site forever. My [DA Resources](/docs/DA) section finally has some
content - links to other people's resources as well as my own.

I also added a new [tutorial/info dump about RSS](/docs/tutorials/rss) for
people who don't know about it, and a recommendation for programs that have RSS
readers built-in or as extensions.

I also updated my font and tweaked the CSS again. The bold color was blending in
too much with links for my liking.
