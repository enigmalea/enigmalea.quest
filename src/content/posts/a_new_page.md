I finally pushed a bunch of changes I was holding back for some reason.

## New Page!

- Added a new page for my robinboob ships. The design of this is a little up in
  the air, still, but at least it exists!

## Style Update

- A couple of small style updates. I removed the rounded borders on my main
  divs. The more I looked at them the more I didn't like them.
- Increased the font size of a few headers in my exchange letter.

## Optimization

- Deleted some unnecessary css files and streamlined my styling.
- Added Imgbot to my repo to help optimize images.
