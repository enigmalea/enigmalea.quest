This is my first post from [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org). Initial
set-up took me a couple of hours yesterday, but I'm still tinkering with
settings and such to get it to where I want it. For visitors, nothing has
changed much. For me, I'm hoping this gives me some incentive to add content
more frequently.

I was really looking for a way to easily post to my update log and a few pages
on the go. The hope is that this gives me a reason to move my fanfic updates and
fandom blogging to this site. Due to _hand waves_ everything with twitter, I
think I'm going to be moving my twitter to inactive and relying on other
socials. I thought now was a good time to take some moves toward controlling my
content and decentralization.
