I've been wanting to add a projects page for a long time. I started work on this
page a _long_ time ago (like before FujoGuide went live in April), but got
distracted by everything I was working on and forgot about it. I opened my repo
today to work on something else and found the half-finished branch.

The page layout uses masonry and feels a little fancier than anything I've done,
but the [Masonry Component](https://github.com/paulcollett/react-masonry-css) I
used made it dead simple!

I'm considering a font update and some updates to my Dragon Age resources next.
